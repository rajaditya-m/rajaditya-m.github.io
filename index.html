    <p>&nbsp;</p>


    <p> <span class="gentexts"> I am from the beautiful city of Kolkata in India. Before coming to OSU, I finished my undergraduate studies in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/">Jadavpur University </a>in Kolkata. </span> </p>

    <p> <span class="gentexts">I have also spent a year at the beautiful city of Bengaluru where I was employed by <a href="http://www.synopsys.com/home.aspx">Synopsys India Pvt. Ltd. </a>as an R&amp;D Engineer in the verification group. </span> </p>

    <p><span class="gentexts">I have travelled to quite a few places around the world. Travel truly broadens the mind and help us understand and appreciate the cultural diversity in this world. My principle travels have been around India(my native land). Europe, parts of Asia, the mystical Egypt and ofcourse USA. Of all the places I have visited, my top picks are New York(USA), Prague (Czech Republic), Alexandria(Egypt), Goa(India) and Hampi(India). </span> </p>

    <p><span class="gentexts">Recalculating the subspace basis of a deformable body is a mandatory procedure for subspace simulation, after the body gets
modified by interactive applications. However, using linear modal analysis to calculate the basis from scratch is known to be
computationally expensive. In the paper, we show that the subspace of a modified body can be efficiently obtained from the
subspace of its original version, if mesh changes are small. Our basic idea is to approximate the stiffness matrix by its low-
frequency component, so we can calculate new linear deformation modes by solving an incremental eigenvalue decomposition
problem. To further handle nonlinear deformations in the subspace, we present a hybrid approach to calculate modal deriva-
tives from both new and original linear modes. Finally, we demonstrate that the cubature samples trained for the original mesh
can be reused in fast reduced force and stiffness matrix evaluation, and we explore the use of our techniques in various sim-
ulation problems. Our experiment shows that the updated subspace basis still allows a simulator to generate visual plausible
deformation effects. The whole system is efficient and it is compatible with other subspace construction approaches. </span></p>

    <p><span class="gentexts">Multi-domain subspace simulation can efficiently and conveniently
simulate the deformation of a large deformable body, by constrain-
ing the deformation of each domain into a different subspace. The
key challenge in implementing this method is how to handle the
coupling among multiple deformable domains, so that the overall
effect is free of gap or locking issues. In this paper, we present a
new domain decomposition framework that connects two disjoint
domains through coupling elements. Under this framework, we
present a unified simulation system that solves subspace deforma-
tions and rigid motions of all of the domains by a single linear solve.
Since the coupling elements are part of the deformable body, their
elastic properties are the same as the rest of the body and our system
does not need stiffness parameter tuning. To quickly evaluate the
reduced elastic forces and their Jacobian matrices caused by the
coupling elements, we further develop two cubature optimization
schemes using uniform and non-uniform cubature weights. Our
experiment shows that the whole system can efficiently handle large
and complex scenes, many of which cannot be easily simulated by
previous techniques without limitations. </span></p>
